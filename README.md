A powerful, AI-driven stock analysis tool that leverages real-time and historical data to provide actionable investment insights. Built with Node.js, Yahoo Finance API, and Groq LLM.

## Features

- Fetches real-time and historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
- Analyzes key financial metrics (P/E ratio, market cap, 52-week high/low, volume, etc.)
- Compares stocks to sector benchmarks
- Provides clear buy/hold/sell recommendations with step-by-step reasoning
- Highlights risks, uncertainties, and external factors
- Customizable analysis period

// You can now use a company name, description, or ticker symbol:
const result = await analyzeStock('Apple Inc.');
console.log(result);

const result2 = await analyzeStock('Microsoft', { period1: '2024-01-01', period2: '2025-01-01' });
console.log(result2);
```
